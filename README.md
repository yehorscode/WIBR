# Will I Be Rich (WIBR)
Made for Summer of Making

### Story
Ever wanted to calculate how much shells you will get on your project?
Do you have anxiety, you can't sleep, stressing by how fast you can reach your beloved prize?
Well you are in the right place! Just answer some questions and calculate your shell percentage!
I do not guarantee you will get the amount i say you will. 
You can get lower amounts of shells
A much lower amount of shells. But u can always hope

### How to run!
As always, you have a mental disorder and u are scared of vercel. you want to run the site locally with 400% security. here is how: i dont use windows so idk how to use it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yehorscode/WIBR.git yehor_on_ur_pc_WIBR && cd yehor_on_ur_pc_WIBR && echo I am ON YOUR PC!!!!!! CRYPTO MINER INSTALLING!!!!! && echo im joking srry i scared u && echo installing dependencies && npm i && echo prob done && echo running && npm run dev && enjoy
```

maybe windows? idk:
made for cmd not tested, try on ur own risk, it may not work cuz npm

```cmd
git clone https://github.com/yehorscode/WIBR yehor_on_ur_pc_WIBR && cd yehor_on_ur_pc_WIBR && npm i && npm run dev
```
